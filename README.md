# Pizza-Business üçï

This project involves a fictional pizzeria with some randomly generated data and we, as good BI experts, are tasked with helping them out by designing a database to store 
their needed data, as well as several queries to pull the necessary data to create the dashboards they will use to monitor business performance. We'll use QuickDBD 
(https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/) to design a database before populating it with the data and then querying it. As some of the project materials were purchased, only 
the queries and documentation I constructed in SQL Server will be posted here.

Project and data supplied by Adam Finer at LearnBI.online (https://learnbi.online/), where lots of other useful information can be found!

My dashboards for the business can be seen here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/todd3092/viz/PizzaBusiness/Story1
